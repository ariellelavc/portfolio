# Computational Drug Discovery

* Computer-aided drug discovery strategy for targeting the oncogenic activity of MYC in prostate cancer; Development of 70551 lead inhibitor for treatment of the two most aggressive and lethal forms of prostate cancer: castration-resistant (CRPC) and neuroendocrine (NEPC). 

* Cheminformatics modeling with engineered protein-ligand interactions' descriptors predictive of adverse drug responses by novel, clinically relevant mutants of human androgen receptor in CRPC.
