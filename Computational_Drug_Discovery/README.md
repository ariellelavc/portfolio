# Computational Drug Discovery

* Computer-aided drug discovery strategy for targeting the oncogenic activity of MYC in prostate cancer; Development of 70551 lead inhibitor for treatment of the two most aggressive and lethal forms of prostate cancer: castration-resistant (CRPC) and neuroendocrine (NEPC). 

* Web-enabled computational drug discovery with Dash and Molstar; Dash web application for visualization of 3D protein-ligand complexes, molecular descriptors and 2D structures of medchem optimized potential inhibitors of hnRNPA1 aberrant alternative splicing in cancer.

* Cheminformatics modeling with engineered protein-ligand interactions' descriptors predictive of adverse drug responses by novel, clinically relevant mutants of human androgen receptor (AR) in CRPC.
